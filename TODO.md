# Plan
1. Update CartSidebar.jsx: Make width responsive (w-full on small screens, w-80 on larger).
2. Review and enhance responsive classes in all components and pages.
3. Add mobile-specific styles in custom.css for better phone experience.
4. Make forms touch-friendly: Increase input sizes on mobile.
5. Adjust sizes for phones: Made elements smaller on phones while keeping laptops same.

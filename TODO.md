 e# TODO: Make Website Phone Responsive and Fix Cart Functionality

## Information Gathered
- The website uses Tailwind CSS for responsiveness, with mobile-first approach.
- Key components: Navbar (has mobile menu), ProductCard (responsive flex), Footer (responsive flex), CartSidebar (fixed width, needs adjustment).
- Pages: Home (grid responsive), Products (grid responsive), Cart (responsive), Checkout (simple), Payment (form).
- Cart functionality: Uses hooks, sidebar, and pages; needs testing on mobile.
- Potential issues: CartSidebar width fixed at 80 (320px), may be too wide on small phones; some elements might overflow; forms need touch-friendly sizing.

## Plan
1. [x] Update CartSidebar.jsx: Make width responsive (w-full on small screens, w-80 on larger).
2. [x] Review and enhance responsive classes in all components and pages.
3. [x] Add mobile-specific styles in custom.css for better phone experience.
4. [x] Make forms touch-friendly: Increase input sizes on mobile.
5. [x] Adjust sizes for phones: Made elements smaller on phones while keeping laptops same.
6. [x] Created separate CSS files: phone-responsive.css for phones (max-width: 767px) and laptop-responsive.css for laptops (min-width: 768px).
7. [x] Updated components to use CSS classes instead of Tailwind responsive prefixes.
8. [x] Imported the new CSS files in main.jsx.
9. [x] Modified ProductCard to integrate Add to Cart button inside the card for mobile (rectangle shape overlay).
10. [ ] Ensure cart functionality works on mobile: Test adding/removing items, checkout flow.
11. [ ] Test all pages on phone: Home, Products, Cart, Checkout, Payment, etc.
12. [ ] Fix any overflow or layout issues on small screens.

## Followup Steps

- [ ] Ensure no horizontal scroll, elements fit screen (browser tool disabled, manual testing recommended).
- [ ] If issues, iterate on fixes.
